# WarGameTradePMR
By Sourav Chatterjee

The War Game project was developed using the following:
css, Bootstrap, html, JavaScript

I have used WebStorm IDE to design and develop the project. 
Download this project from github and open the project in Webstorm. 
All you have to do is run the index.html and the game will begin

Hope you like the code
